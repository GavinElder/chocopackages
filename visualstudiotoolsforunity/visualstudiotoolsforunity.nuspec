    <description># A Visual Studio extension for helping Unity development

Note: you need _an_ edition of Visual Studio 2015.

Unity is a game engine and development environment for creating cross-platform games. The Unity engine runs on over a dozen platforms spanning from powerful PCs, to game consoles, to touch-enabled tablets and mobile phones—even to the web. The Unity editor provides a friendly interface for building rich game worlds. The capability, ease-of-use, and reach of Unity make it a popular choice among today's game developers.

While the Unity editor is great for putting your game world together, you can't write your code in it. With Visual Studio Tools for Unity, you can use the familiar code editing, debugging and productivity features of Visual Studio to create editor and game scripts for your Unity project using C#, and you can debug them using Visual Studio's powerful debugging capabilities.

But Visual Studio Tools for Unity is more than that; it also has deep integration with Unity editor so that you'll spend less time switching back and forth to do simple tasks, provides Unity-specific productivity enhancements, and puts the Unity documentation at your fingertips.</description>
